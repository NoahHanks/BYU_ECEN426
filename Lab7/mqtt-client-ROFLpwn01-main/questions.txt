1. What are the different QoS levels that MQTT provides? Provide an explanation of when you would use each of the QoS levels.

0 - At most once, use if you you already have a good connection or don't care about messages getting lost
1 - At least once, use when you can handle duplicates and multiple deliveries
2 - Exactly once, use when duplicates can harm the system

Different systems are created differently so having different QoS levels allows for program flexibility as well as connection variance.
